Covid SQL Data Analysis

The objective of this workbook is to use SQL to analyze a create tables for Tableau visualization regarding Covid-19. For the simplicity of running this on a personal computer, we will be using SQLite. Link to Tableau Covid-19 Visualization here: https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidAugustReview/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

To begin, we have started by retrieving global Covid-19 data from the following link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. Using DB Browser for SQLite, we created a .db file to explore using the data from the above link. I have compressed it and included it in this repository.

This file is intended showcase SQL skills that would be used to generate tables & csv files that can be explored visually with Tableau.
